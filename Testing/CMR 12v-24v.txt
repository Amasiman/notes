# 12/24v detection

router will always operate at 24v in network

Router will operate at 12 or 24 outside network (standalone)

12/24 mode is CONFIGURED by DOIP
    - Why do you have to configure this?
        - Same DTC's must be used for both
    - would be configured by DOIP  
        - only during software installation

# DTC
Same DTC used for both 12/24
    - no DTC recorded 


Confirm to Carsten

@GNM1PG1 Closing this topic requires the following:
- Clarify the requirement from Carsten (how to check standalone/CIs mode) and confirm if Lesswire understands and can implement this requirement (add to open point list)
- Confirm that  Lesswire understands that there is no DTC difference between 12V/24V.  No DTC generated between 8V - 32V (add to open point list)
- Confirm this information is documented and clear in BPV
