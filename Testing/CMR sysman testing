--------------- Notes
MAC ending
- need implementation details from Dane


AEM generation
- some additions in AEM is complex, CMR team needs assistance with certain topics, e.g. multiplexer
- EIZO use the same AEM tool
- LW request EIZO to share their YAML as example - EIZO will share
- Lesswire will send 


fast forward/seek
- EIZO still finalizing seek values for best user experience
- LW asking EIZO to share values and use the same in their implementation


playlist generation
- playable field
    - why add not playable files (even if marked as not playable)
    - including all files because it's faster than checking each file (optimization)


MP3 encoding
- just increases buffer sizes
- lesswire wanted to know if anyone used testbed to test mp3 content, answer was no
- they have CMA and CMG but need help with configuration.  Units were shipped in September (very old software/firmware)
