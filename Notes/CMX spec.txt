- why is cmg video so delayed, must be faster.


- determine if ptp requirements can be set per device

- confirm reason for the current
- define what we really want


- define hop delay per CMG (passing video content through)
    - per data class 

I have to draw two lines - one is where we currently are with delays (not instant), the next is what we want (instant).  Then
I try and find out how we can bring the two lines closer. This will likely include stream reservation and buffer reduction.

Split powerpoint specs into CMG specific and network as a whole
    - e.g. 20th glass must have gm offset under 500ms but every glass must have pdelay under 20ms
    - clarify that individual specs must pass regardless of hops to GM

As per Michael:
    - define as much as possible PTP requirements PER cmg, and add to the spec slides that the spec test must
        include hops in-between
        - definitely add ptp pdelay then
    - create hop delay specification "sentence"
