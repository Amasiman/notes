DTC discussion
	- clarify findings with Carsten
	- wtf does active mean
	- give Kiran feedback
	- confirm how DTC works in AVBOS with UMAN
		- active DTC always sent
		- can it be cleared without fixing anything?
		- any difference between healthcare and request message? besides power state
			- yes, one returns per id/type, the other returns all? must confirm.

	result
	- "cleared" is only possible via doip. not exposed to sysman
	- "set" is used to set 1st bit to on or off
	- '3rd' byte "dtc confirmed" is historic type, will stay active even after 1st byte clears
	- any issue that has ever been active only once will always be sent

Notes

The DTC server is in DoIP and released in AVBOS.
The interaction to CMC is on supplier - they get the DTC from doip and build a payload
    - it's likely that this is linked to DOIP because I'm betting they simply copy the payload from one to the other, meaning
    the order of DTC is the same as what DOIP gave.  Theres no dates here, so I'm going to guess list position is based on 
    first occurrence.  
    - Perhaps DoIP moves codes forward if updated?
