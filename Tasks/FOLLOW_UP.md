	- help Stefen Volkman troubleshoot apparmor queries
	- The idea is for me to only identify where UMAN has to help (AVBOS os specific implementation of apparmor)
	- component issues is his baby, or I (Bosch) can help


> ask martin to provide CMP avb/gstreamer change notes to UMAN
> check resources from Michael for a beter task tracking tool

> 255 track listing limitation in avdecc
	- follow up with UMAN for details
	- solution/workaround
