CMR meeting with Peter

- DoIP messages required for histogram sensors (non CPU)
- 60s self-protection timer
- stay in protected off until master requests change


Open points
- confirm new 1.2 thermal spec and share with LW
- push UMAN to confirm why CPU histogram started failing in 6.1.3
- confirm DoIP requirement for pulling individual sensor histogram
- get UMAN to confirm that getDTC and eventDTC is in same "replacable" plugin structure
    - also improve documentation


------------------- Standalone differences

- no nanomsg
 - Follow-Up Time (shutdown delay) for standalone mode
 - BPV 292

 - software update power mode not mentioned in standalone mode
    - clarify and define test/verification specs

 - LW recommends we use protected off mode in critical area already because there is no power master to adapt (e.g. system always critical too much)

 - confirm cascading mode wrt standalone and cis

 - device ID (NR) needs clarification
    - do we need it
    - how do we set it

 - confirm adapting LPSD phy is required?


 --------------------------------

 Standalone power management implementation requires clarification:
- Standalone mode requires different power management, but it still uses all of the interfaces built into sysman.
- Having two versions of sysman software will require too much work and maintenance for Lesswire (which will translate to costs for Bosch).
Specify IP ranges

Sysman will be required in both standalone and CIS versions, because of self-protection. Remove references to Sysman and only refer to requirements, e.g. in standalone mode there is no LPSD and IGN PIN is the only wake-up trigger. We must avoid commenting on their implementation to avoid confusion / new work packages.

how will standalone router be configured if it will stay in standalone



installation requirements:

configure sysman standalone
static IP in standalone to save time?



-----------------------

CMP gets 300 hertz clock (CRF)


SDMA IN


TODO
   - extract audio from capture to check if its okay
   - increase PTS
   - route sample clock to 1588 IN
   - debug output
   - accurate measurement of packet send time
   - every 4th packet does not need a timestamp
